# Stampede-Detection-System
This project aims to develop a stampede detection system that analyzes crowd density, changes in direction, and motion patterns to detect potential stampede risks. The system processes images from an online dataset using FiftyOne and YOLO, identifies anomalous movement, and triggers alerts in high-risk scenarios.
