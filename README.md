# Stampede-Detection-System

# Overview
This project aims to develop a stampede detection system that analyzes crowd density, changes in direction, and motion patterns to detect potential stampede risks. The system processes images from an online dataset using FiftyOne and YOLO, identifies anomalous movement, and triggers alerts in high-risk scenarios.

# Problem Statement
In dense environments such as metro stations, concerts, and public gatherings, there is a possibilty of crowd surge, that can lead to serious injuries or fatalities. The objective of this project is to:

- Detect crowd density levels to assess congestion risk.
- Identify anomalous movement patterns that indicate potential stampedes.
- Recognize falling individuals and provide real-time alerts when stampede risks are detected.
